# clustering_customers
Business problem: client wants to know more about their customer base, they want to be able to segment customers into distinct groups. Data might include demographic, economic, and lifestyle information. Imagine a wide dataset, several hundred variables with lots of redundant information. How do you know which features are most important? How do you know your groupings are meaningful? Solution: clustering analysis. This unsupervised machine learning approach maximizes the distance between centroids, with customers sorted into groups based on which features are most similar. Imagine the Sorting Hat from Harry Potter, but...ya know...it's an optimization algorithm. The second half of the notebook employs Shapley values to identify which variables mattered in defining the different clusters.
Notebook for customer segmentation and ranking feature importance. Primary methods: k-modes clustering (categorical variables) and Shapley values (to understand key features).
